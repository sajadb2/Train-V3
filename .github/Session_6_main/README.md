# MNIST Digit Classification with PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The model achieves high accuracy on MNIST digit classification using a modern CNN architecture with regularization techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by ReLU activations, max pooling, and fully connected layers. Regularization techniques such as Batch Normalization and Dropout are used to improve generalization.

## Features

- **Architecture**: Custom CNN with multiple convolutional layers
- **Regularization**: BatchNorm, Dropout (0.1)
